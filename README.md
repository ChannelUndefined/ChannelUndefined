Wowzers, it's me!

Who am I? I use my spare time to program things.

I am currently an amateur at programming in a few languages. I primarily modify open source projects to fit my own needs.
Some of my biggest projects include:

- Chloramine - A discontinued discord bot with over 125 commands
 
- Spot - The descendant of Chloramine, currently still under development
 
- Totally Accurate Nerf Gun Simulator - A cheap FPS school project made in Unity WebGL


As we are currently nearing the end of my 8th grade school year, I would like to say a few things to my school's admins.
It was fun constantly creating new sites to circumvent the blocks.

And (insert name of admin who blocks sites), half those proxy browser sites were mine. :)

Farewell.
